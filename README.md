# About the Project

This project was developed during the Python Developer Course, made by Digital Innovation One. It is a basic Bank System, which allows deposits, withdrawals and statements. 

On version 2.0 I updated the code with functions that perform the specified actions. 

On version 3.0 I refactored the code with an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. I created classes that represent all the required entities, such as the Client, Account, History of Transactions, Deposit and Withdrawals. Each account belongs to only one client and a client can have multiple accounts.

There is also a function that requires a password to operate, however it is not a real case scenario, because the password is exposed in the code. Normally the password would be protected in a database, this is just an imaginary example to show that this is possible to make.
